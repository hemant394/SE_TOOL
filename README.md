# CodeSearch : Tool for searching cpp related queries on different sites


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Motivation

This is the README for  extension "CodeSearch". 
We know how c++ is widely used nowadays by competitive
programmers and Naive programmers So there is very less
probability that they won’t encounter any errors while using
different standard template libraries and different other inbuilt
functions. We also know that Since 2012, C++ is on a three-year
release schedule, with C++23 as the next planned standard So it is
very likely to see some new changes and eventually face errors.
So now we understood that errors are bound to happen. Now
Question arises how to resolve them with wasting least amount of
time and energy.So we know searching takes time So we have
developed a VS Code Extension which allows users to search
different queries from within VS Code. It will save lot of time
of programmers and will boost their efficiency and Speed.

### Use Case
Our Tool comes handy for new programmers who encounter with
errors more frequently and don’t know where to search. it is very
tedious job to search on google and find different solutions for
errors that is where our tool comes into picture. user can use our
tool to search different errors on stack overflow or user can also
search different important inbuilt functions and data structures
on cppreference. on cppreference user will be able to find documentation
of different data structure present in standard template
libraries and functions which can be used on them. user will be
able to learn in depth if he/she searches it on cppreference through
our tool which will redirect user to that link and user will no more
have to search it on google. Now we can take an example of one of
the many use cases of our tool. if user is having problem knowing
different functions which he/she can operate on priority queue
then user can select priority queue keyword and can search it on
cppreference using proper command and user will be able to see
different in depth knowledge on priority queue and different functions
revolving around it.One another scenario where user can use
our app is if user wants to fetch different similar programs from
github then user can click on "githubresults" command and then
tool will open a search engine for github where user can search
anything on github and will able to open them and user can learn
about different coding practices which programmers use
