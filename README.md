# CodeSearch : Tool for searching cpp related queries on different sites


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Motivation

This is the README for  extension "CodeSearch". 
We know how c++ is widely used nowadays by competitive
programmers and Naive programmers So there is very less
probability that they wonâ€™t encounter any errors while using
different standard template libraries and different other inbuilt
functions. We also know that Since 2012, C++ is on a three-year
release schedule, with C++23 as the next planned standard So it is
very likely to see some new changes and eventually face errors.
So now we understood that errors are bound to happen. Now
Question arises how to resolve them with wasting least amount of
time and energy.So we know searching takes time So we have
developed a VS Code Extension which allows users to search
different queries from within VS Code. It will save lot of time
of programmers and will boost their efficiency and Speed.
